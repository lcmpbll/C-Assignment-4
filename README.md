## By Liam Campbell

## Description

This program will let you know about how many Jellybeans are in a given area, perhaps a jar or something like it.

Enter the length and height of your beans, average jellybeans are 2 cm by 1.5 cm (about 2.95 cm^3) along with the volume of your jar. 

The program will then tell you about how many jellies are in your jar. You may then choose to add more jellies and jars for comparison. 

When you are all done your totals will be displayed including: 

Total number of entries
Average number of jellybeans per jar
The volume of the largest jellybean
and the volume of the jar that held the most jellybeans.
